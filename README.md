# Advanced Machine Learning

This repository contains assignments and projects from an Advanced Machine Learning course, covering Bayesian methods, neural networks, and reinforcement learning.

## Projects

### [Bayesian Linear Regression](./Bayesian_Linear_Regression/)
Implementation of Bayesian Linear Regression with uncertainty quantification, applied to concrete strength prediction and Bayesian optimization.

### [Neural Network Protein Engineering](./Neural_Network_Protein_Engineering/)
Transformer-based models for predicting protein activity levels, including manual implementation of attention backpropagation.

### [Reinforcement Learning - Lunar Lander](./Reinforcement_Learning-Lunar_Lander/)
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) implementation for training an agent to land a spacecraft in the Lunar Lander environment.

## Structure

Each folder contains:
- A Jupyter notebook with the implementation
- A README with project-specific details, dependencies, and instructions

## Getting Started

Navigate to each project folder for specific setup instructions and dependencies.
